# star-flasher

The default behavior of * is to put the word under the cursor ('cword') into the 
search register and jump to the next occurence. This plugin modifies this 
behavior with the following:

  1. fix the cursor in the same place
  2. gives a visual feedback by flashing the text that was just copied
  3. works from visual mode

## Installation

vim-plug:
```vimL
Plug 'yuki-uthman/vim-star-flasher'
```

vundle:
```vimL
Plugin 'yuki-uthman/vim-star-flasher'
```

minpac:
```vimL
call minpac#add('yuki-uthman/vim-star-flasher')
```

## Configuration

To change the duration of the flash:
```vimL
" default is set to 500 (unit is in milliseconds)
let g:star_flasher_duration = 500
```

The default color of the flash is set to 'IncSearch' highlight group. The exact 
color would depend on your colorscheme. You can change to any highlight group by 
changing the flasher highlight group:
```vimL
" default is set to 'IncSearch'
let g:star_flasher_highlight = 'Visual'
```
However setting this variable to 'Search' is not recommended due to the fact 
that when the text is already highlighted with hlsearch the flash would not be 
visible as it would flash with the same color.

To see all the highlight groups that are defined in your colorscheme:
```vimL
:highlight
```

If you want to define your own highlight group:
```vimL
" for terminal
" ctermfg as the font color
" ctermbg as the background color
highlight flasherColor ctermfg='White' ctermbg='Black'

" for gui
" guifg as the font color
" guibg as the background color
highlight flasherColor guifg='White' guibg='Black'

let g:star_flasher_highlight = 'flasherColor'
```
The following colors are available in most systems:
  - Black
  - Brown
  - Gray
  - Blue
  - Green
  - Cyan
  - Red
  - Magenta
  - Yellow
  - White

To see more colors:
```vimL
h cterm-colors
h gui-colors
```

To set custom color using RGB:
